Repository for SearchAndSeek

Notes:

All files are initially encoded as UTF-8. This isn't the default for some IDEs, so you should change that in the preferences.
Line endings of text files are Windows format (CR-LF). That should be the default in any Windows IDE.

If we mess something up, we can always start over again.
